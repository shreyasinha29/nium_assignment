**Stock Price Prediction with Linear Regression**

Overview

This project aims to predict stock prices based on historical data using a linear regression model. The model is trained on historical stock prices and day numbers, and it is evaluated on a separate test set to assess its predictive performance.

**Data**

Source: Synthetic data generated with linear relationship between days and stock prices.

Features: Day - Standardized day numbers from 1 to 100.
Target: Price - Historical stock prices.

Model Algorithm

-Linear Regression: The model uses linear regression to establish a relationship between the day numbers and stock prices.
-Training: The model is trained using a gradient descent algorithm to minimize the mean squared error between the predicted and actual stock prices.
-Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated on a test set using mean squared error as the evaluation metric.
-Results: The model's predictions are visualized alongside the historical stock prices to assess its accuracy and performance.
